//example 1:
let x = 10;
if (x > 5)
    console.log(x + " is greater than 5");
//output: 10 is greater than 5

//example 2:
let x1 = 8;
if (x1 > 5)
    console.log(x1 + " is greater than 5");
console.log(x1 + " is greater than 5");
//NOTE: if the statement is not enclosed in braces, it will execute only the first statement.

//example 3:
let x2 = 8;
if (x2 > 8)
    console.log(x2 + " is greater than 8");
